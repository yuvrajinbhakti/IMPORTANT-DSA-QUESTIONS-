/*
Given an undirected graph with V vertices. We say two vertices u and v belong to a single province if there is a path from u to v or v to u. Your task is to find the number of provinces.

Note: A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

Example 1:

Input:
[
 [1, 0, 1],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1]
]

Output:
2
Explanation:
The graph clearly has 2 Provinces [1,3] and [2]. As city 1 and city 3 has a path between them they belong to a single province. City 2 has no path to city 1 or city 3 hence it belongs to another province.
